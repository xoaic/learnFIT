Object class identification
By this stage in the design process, you should have some ideas about the essential objects in the system that you are designing. As your understanding of the design develops, you refine these ideas about the system objects. The use case description helps to identify objects and operations in the system. From the description of the Report weather use case, it is obvious that you will need to implement objects representing the instruments that collect weather data and an object representing the summary of the weather data. You also usually need a high-level system object or objects that encapsulate the system interactions defined in the use cases. With these objects in mind, you can start to identify the general object classes in the system.
