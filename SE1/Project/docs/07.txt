Design patterns
Design patterns were derived from ideas put forward by Christopher Alexander (Alexander 1979), who suggested that there were certain common patterns of building design that were inherently pleasing and effective. The pattern is a description of the problem and the essence of its solution, so that the solution may be reused in different settings. The pattern is not a detailed specification. Rather, you can think of it as a description of accumulated wisdom and experience, a well-tried solution to a common problem. A quote from the Hillside Group website (hillside.net/patterns/), which is dedicated to maintaining information about patterns, encapsulates their role in reuse: Patterns and Pattern Languages are ways to describe best practices, good designs, and capture experience in a way that it is possible for others to reuse this experience. Patterns have made a huge impact on object-oriented software design. As well as being tested solutions to common problems, they have become a vocabulary for talking about a design. You can therefore explain your design by describing the patterns that you have used. This is particularly true for the best known design patterns that were originally described by the 'Gang of Four' in their patterns book, published in 1995 (Gamma et al. 1995). Other important pattern descriptions are those published in a series of books by authors from Siemens, a large European technology company (Buschmann et al. 1996; Schmidt et al. 2000; Kircher and Jain 2004; Buschmann, Henney, and Schmidt 2007a, 2007b).
