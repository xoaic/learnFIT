Architectural design
Once the interactions between the software system and the system's environment have been defined, you use this information as a basis for designing the system architecture. Of course, you need to combine this knowledge with your general knowledge of the principles of architectural design and with more detailed domain knowledge. You identify the major components that make up the system and their interactions. You may then design the system organization using an architectural pattern such as a layered or client-server model. The high-level architectural design for the weather station software is shown in Figure 7.4. The weather station is composed of independent subsystems that communicate by broadcasting messages on a common infrastructure, shown as Communication link in Figure 7.4. Each subsystem listens for messages on that infrastructure and picks up the messages that are intended for them. This 'listener model' is a commonly used architectural style for distributed systems.
