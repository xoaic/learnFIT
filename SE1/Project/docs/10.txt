Configuration management
In software development, change happens all the time, so change management is absolutely essential. When several people are involved in developing a software system, you have to make sure that team members don't interfere with each other's work. That is, if two people are working on a component, their changes have to be coordinated. Otherwise, one programmer may make changes and overwrite the other's work. You also have to ensure that everyone can access the most up-to-date versions of software components; otherwise developers may redo work that has already been done. When something goes wrong with a new version of a system, you have to be able to go back to a working version of the system or component. Configuration management is the name given to the general process of managing a changing software system. The aim of configuration management is to support the system integration process so that all developers can access the project code and documents in a controlled way, find out what changes have been made, and compile and link components to create a system. As shown in Figure 7.14, there are four fundamental configuration management activities.
