Pattern name: Observer
Description: Separates the display of the state of an object from the object itself and allows alternative displays to be provided. When the object state changes, all displays are automatically notified and updated to reflect the change. Problem description: In many situations, you have to provide multiple displays of state information, such as a graphical display and a tabular display. Not all of these may be known when the information is specified. All alternative presentations should support interaction and, when the state is changed, all displays must be updated. This pattern may be used in situations where more than one display format for state information is required and where it is not necessary for the object that maintains the state information to know about the specific display formats used.
